### Hi, I'm Bruno Iglesias. 👋

E-mail: bruno.iglesias.eng@gmail.com



I am a finalist in Software Engineering at the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM) and at the same time I am studying Mathematics at Estácio College, I work professionally in the area of research and development of artificial intelligence technologies, machine vision, robotics and autonomous navigation using python as the main language .

Here you will find materials from personal projects, research and studies carried out, for example:


  🧠 Artificial neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow <br/>
  🧬 Genetic Algorithms <br/>
  📈 Classic models for classification, regression and grouping<br/>
  👁️‍🗨️ Computer vision and digital image processing with OpenCV<br/>
 	📊 Statistics applied to data analysis and machine learning <br/>
  🤖 Robotics and autonomous navigation with ROS (robot operating system) <br/>
  👉 And More
  
### Languages
My English is always in progress. I can read, write, listen and understand, but I haven't had many opportunities to practice speaking.
