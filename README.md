### Hi, I'm Bruno Iglesias. 👋

E-mail: bruno.iglesias.eng@gmail.com


I have a bachelor's degree in software engineering from the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM) and I'm a student of the bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Estácio College, I work professionally in the area of research and development of artificial intelligence technologies, machine vision, robotics and autonomous navigation using python as main language.

Here you will find materials from personal projects, research and studies carried out, for example:


  🧠 Artificial neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow <br/>
  🧬 Genetic Algorithms <br/>
  📈 Classic models for classification, regression and grouping<br/>
  👁️‍🗨️ Computer vision and digital image processing with OpenCV<br/>
 	📊 Statistics applied to data analysis and machine learning <br/>
  🤖 Robotics and autonomous navigation with ROS (robot operating system) <br/>
  👉 And More
  
### Languages
My English is always in progress. I can read, write, listen and understand, but I haven't had many opportunities to practice speaking.
